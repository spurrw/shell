==== Compiling Program and Running ====
	You can compile my shell program by typing the command
'gcc -o shell shell.c'

	To run the shell program, type ./shell from the directory you placed
the binary file in. Make sure it is executable by and use the command
'chmod a+x shell' if needed.


==== Challenges ====

	The first challenge I encountered was how to remove a trailing '\n'
from a string gotten from stdin by fgets. I found a solution at
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2693776/removing-trailing-newline-character-from-fgets-input using the function strcspn.
